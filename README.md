You have 2 options, run the script in AutoHotKey software, or opening the excecutable version.

LOLAutoCallPick is an AutoHotKey script, so, if you have problems or you do not trust in the excecutable, just download for free AutoHotKey (google it), and then run the script file LOLAutoCallPick.ahk, this file it's just a simple plain text file, so you can open it in notepad towatch inside the code and see what's actually doing.
